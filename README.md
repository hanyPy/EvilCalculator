# EvilCalculator
* Its a calculator, that asks YOU questions!
* Uh, and it will insult you when you get an answer wrong.

## Things I want to add:
* Better insults, really.
* More operations.
* The program looping until you ask it to stop, thus you get to answer more questions without re-running the program continously.
